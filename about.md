# ""Icon"" Kit

---

This mod simply allows you to set any icon for any gamemode, with varying results.


It will attempt to warp the icon to fit the gamemode, such as rounding out cube
icons for ball, scaling up waves for cube and so on which can lead to some
certainly breathtaking, beautiful, gorgeous, attractive, pretty, prepossessing,
charming, delightful, beautiful, alluring results depending on what you choose!
